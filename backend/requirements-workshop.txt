# Workshop-Optimized Requirements
# This file contains the packages needed to run the app AND load data
# Installation time: ~2-3 minutes (faster than full requirements)
#
# NOTE: This assumes QDRANT_CLOUD_INFERENCE=true
#       Cloud inference means Qdrant generates embeddings server-side
#       So we don't need sentence-transformers locally!

# Core Framework
fastapi==0.115.0
uvicorn[standard]==0.32.0
pydantic==2.9.2
pydantic-settings==2.6.0
python-multipart==0.0.12
python-dotenv==1.0.1

# Vector Store (Qdrant Cloud)
qdrant-client==1.15

# LLM & HTTP
groq==0.11.0
httpx==0.27.2

# Embeddings (for semantic search)
# When using Qdrant Cloud Inference, you DON'T need these - Qdrant embeds server-side
# Uncomment these only if setting QDRANT_CLOUD_INFERENCE=false
# sentence-transformers==3.2.1  # Only needed if not using cloud inference
# transformers==4.46.2  # Required dependency of sentence-transformers

# Data Loading (for workshop scripts - loads Wikipedia articles)
datasets==3.1.0  # HuggingFace datasets (pulls in pandas as dependency)
tqdm==4.66.5
# pandas==2.2.3  # Only needed for parquet loading scripts (not used in workshop)

# Document Processing (for file uploads)
pypdf2==3.0.1  # PDF fallback parser
python-docx==1.1.2  # Word documents
pdfplumber==0.11.4  # Primary PDF parser

# NOTE: These are commented out because they're not directly used:
# pillow==11.0.0  # Image embeddings exist in code but embed_image() is never called
# torch  # Pulled in by sentence-transformers dependency (only used in unused embed_image methods)
# pandas==2.2.3  # Pulled in by datasets dependency (not needed for workshop data loading)
