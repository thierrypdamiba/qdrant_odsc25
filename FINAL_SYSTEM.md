## 🎯 What To Try

### 1. Live Streaming (Recommended!)
**http://localhost:3000/query-stream**

**Try this query:**
```
"What is Anarchism and what are the latest developments in anarchist movements?"
```

**You'll see live:**
```
0.0s: 🚀 Initializing...
0.4s: 🔍 Checking cache...
0.8s: ❌ Cache MISS
0.9s: 🔤 Embedding query... +9ms
1.0s: 📚 Searching Qdrant... 
1.0s: ✓ Found 2 sources +4ms ⚡ (see how fast!)
1.1s: 🔬 Evaluating quality... +278ms
1.4s: 🎯 Agent Decision: HYBRID
1.5s: 🌐 Searching internet... (this takes a while)
29s:  ✓ Internet complete +27s (now you know why!)
29s:  ✅ Complete!
```

**Plus live performance bars growing** as each step completes!

### 2. Test Cache Speedup
1. Ask: "What is Anarchism?"
2. Watch it process (~15-30 seconds)
3. Ask **same question** again
4. Watch: ⚡ **CACHE HIT!** (~700ms, 20x faster!)

### 3. See Agent Intelligence
**Query**: "What is Python programming?"
- Agent searches locally first
- Finds Wikipedia article
- Evaluates: "Quality 0.82 - sufficient!"
- Decision: LOCAL ONLY (no internet needed)

**Query**: "Latest tech news October 2025?"
- Agent searches locally
- Finds nothing relevant
- Evaluates: "Quality 0.08 - very limited!"
- Decision: INTERNET ONLY (skip local)

### 4. Performance Visibility
Watch performance breakdown show:
```
⚡ Qdrant Search: 4ms (0.130%) ← Super fast!
🤖 Groq LLM: 1,638ms (5.8%)
🌐 Internet: 27,903ms (87.5%) ← Bottleneck!
```

## 🎬 Demo Script

Perfect demo flow to show all features:

### Step 1: Show Agent Intelligence
```
Page: http://localhost:3000/query-stream
Query: "What is Anarchism?"
Mode: Auto

Watch:
- Agent checks cache (MISS)
- Searches Qdrant (4ms - FAST!)
- Evaluates quality (45% - partial)
- Decides: HYBRID
- Adds internet search (28s - slow)
- Caches result
```

### Step 2: Show Cache Speedup
```
Same page, same query
Watch:
- Agent checks cache (HIT!)
- Returns instantly (700ms)
- 20x faster!
```

### Step 3: Show Internet-Only Decision
```
Query: "What are today's tech announcements?"
Watch:
- Searches local (0 results)
- Quality: 0% - no local data
- Decision: INTERNET ONLY
- Skips local, goes straight to Perplexity
```

### Step 4: Show Permission Enforcement
```
Logout, login as "local_user"
Query: "Latest news?"
Watch:
- Agent knows user lacks internet permission
- Decision: LOCAL (even though quality is low)
- Works within user's constraints
```
