# 📡 Real-Time Streaming Features

## Overview

Your system now supports **real-time streaming** of the agent's workflow! Users see each step as it happens instead of waiting for the final result.

## ✅ What's Been Added

### 1. Streaming API Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `POST /query/stream`

**Technology**: Server-Sent Events (SSE)

**Features**:
- Streams progress updates in real-time
- Shows each agent decision as it happens
- Displays timing for each component
- Can be cancelled mid-stream

### 2. Enhanced Performance Tracking
**Now shows precision down to 0.001%** so even 4ms Qdrant searches are visible!

**Example**:
```
Query Embedding........... 9ms (0.391%)
Qdrant Vector Search...... 3ms (0.130%) ⚡
Groq LLM Generation....... 1,087ms (47.2%)
Internet Search........... 27,903ms (87.5%) ← Bottleneck!
```

### 3. Live Streaming UI
**Page**: http://localhost:3000/query-stream

**Features**:
- Real-time event display
- Progress indicators
- Cancellable queries
- Live workflow visualization

## 📺 How It Works

### Backend (Server-Sent Events):
```python
@router.post("/stream")
async def query_stream(...):
    # Stream events as they happen
    yield "event: status\ndata: {\"message\": \"Checking cache...\"}\n\n"
    # Do work...
    yield "event: status\ndata: {\"message\": \"Searching Qdrant...\", \"time_ms\": 4}\n\n"
    # More work...
    yield "event: result\ndata: {\"answer\": \"...\", \"sources\": [...]}\n\n"
```

### Frontend (EventSource):
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/query/stream', {...});
const reader = response.body.getReader();

// Read stream chunk by chunk
while (true) {
  const {value, done} = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;
  
  // Parse SSE events and update UI immediately
  parseAndDisplay(value);
}
```

## 🎯 Real-Time Event Flow

When user submits query, they see updates like:

```
🔴 Agent Workflow (Live)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. 🚀 Initializing services...
2. 🔍 Checking semantic cache...          +756ms
3. ❌ Cache MISS - processing query...
4. 🔤 Generating query embedding...
5. ✓ Query embedded                        +9ms
6. 📚 Searching Qdrant vector database...
7. ✓ Found 3 sources from Qdrant          +4ms
8. 🔬 Evaluating context quality...
9. ✓ Quality: 0.45 - Partial information   +127ms
   Score: 45.0% (Vector: 43%, Coverage: 0%, LLM: 70%)
10. 🎯 Agent Decision: HYBRID (enhance with internet)
11. 🌐 Searching internet with Perplexity...
12. ✓ Internet search complete             +27903ms
13. 💾 Caching result...
14. ✅ Complete! Total time: 28799ms
```

**User sees each step appear live as processing happens!**

## 🆚 Comparison

### Old Way (Regular Query):
```
User clicks "Search"
→ ⏳ Waiting... (30 seconds of nothing)
→ ✓ Results appear
```

### New Way (Streaming):
```
User clicks "Search"
→ 🔍 Checking cache... (instant feedback)
→ 📚 Searching Qdrant... +4ms (see it's fast!)
→ 🔬 Evaluating quality... (know what's happening)
→ 🌐 Internet search... (see this is the slow part!)
→ ✓ Results appear (understand why it took 30s)
```

## 📊 Precision Improvements

### Before:
```
Qdrant: 1329ms (0%)  ← Looked slow, actually wasn't
```

### After:
```
Query Embedding: 11ms (0.391%)
Qdrant Search: 4ms (0.130%) ⚡  ← Now visible & precise!
LLM Generation: 1638ms (58.1%)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Users see Qdrant is actually fast
- ✅ Understand LLM generation takes time
- ✅ Know internet search is the bottleneck
- ✅ Appreciate cache speedup (0.130% vs 87%)

### Traditional Query (Post-Result):
**http://localhost:3000/query**
- Shows workflow after completion
- Good for final analysis
- Clean results view

### Live Streaming (Real-Time):
**http://localhost:3000/query-stream**
- Watch agent work in real-time
- See each step as it happens
- Cancel anytime
- Perfect for understanding performance

## 🎬 Try It Now!

### Test Streaming:

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000/query-stream

2. **Try queries**:
   - "What is Anarchism?" → Watch agent check cache, search Qdrant, evaluate, decide
   - "Latest tech news?" → See it skip Qdrant, go straight to internet
   - Same query again → Watch instant cache hit!

3. **Watch the timeline**:
   ```
   Live updates appear:
   0s: "Checking cache..."
   0.1s: "Cache MISS"
   0.2s: "Searching Qdrant..."
   0.3s: "Found 3 sources +4ms" ← See Qdrant is fast!
   0.5s: "Evaluating quality..."
   1.5s: "Quality: 0.45 - Partial" ← Understand decision
   1.6s: "Agent Decision: HYBRID"
   1.7s: "Searching internet..." ← Know what's taking time
   29s: "Internet complete +27s" ← See the bottleneck!
   29.1s: "Complete!"
   ```

## 📈 Performance Visibility

Users now understand:

| Component | Typical Time | % of Total | User Understanding |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Embedding | 10-20ms | <1% | "Query prep is instant" |
| **Qdrant** | **3-10ms** | **<1%** | **"Vector search is blazing fast!"** |
| LLM Gen | 1-3s | 5-15% | "AI thinking takes a moment" |
| Context Eval | 100-300ms | 1-5% | "Quality check is quick" |
| **Internet** | **8-30s** | **80-95%** | **"Internet search is the bottleneck!"** |
| Cache Store | 50-100ms | <1% | "Caching for next time is cheap" |

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **No More Blind Waiting** - Users see progress
2. **Understand Bottlenecks** - Know why it's slow
3. **Appreciate Qdrant** - See it's actually fast (4ms!)
4. **Transparency** - Build trust with visible reasoning
5. **Cancellable** - Stop long-running queries
6. **Educational** - Learn how RAG works

## 🔧 Technical Details

### SSE Format:
```
event: status
data: {"step":"qdrant_search","message":"Searching...","timestamp":0.2}

event: status
data: {"step":"qdrant_done","message":"Found 3 sources","time_ms":4}

event: result
data: {"answer":"...","sources":[...],"mode":"hybrid"}
```

### Event Types:
- `status` - Progress update
- `result` - Final answer
- `error` - Error occurred

### Cancellation:
User can click "Cancel" button to abort mid-stream using AbortController.
